# VLSI-DESIGN
This project focuses on the design and architectural modeling of a scalable SRAM-based Look-Up Table (LUT) for high-density FPGA fabrics. The objective is to develop a modular and area-efficient LUT architecture that supports logic scalability, low power consumption, and high-speed operation suitable for modern FPGA implementations.
